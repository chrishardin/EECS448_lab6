PeekFront;
	-> Using t_peek_nonempty, it seems like peekFront doesnt work the way it should. I enqueue 25, 15, 5 and it doesnt pass when looking at 25 but it passes for 5. 
	-> looks at the back.

Dequeue;
	-> Using t_dequeue_peek, it seems it removes to back instead of removing the front.
	-> Enqueued 1-10, dequeued 3 times should remove 1,2,3 but it removes 10,9,8
	-> tested with looking for 4, and it couldnt see it
	-> tested with looking for 7, and it could see it
clean;
	-> *~ in Makefile gave errors so it was removed.

Memory leaks;
	-> using valgrind (make m), we get total heap usage: 99 allocs, 26 frees
	-> the destructor I dont think it deallocating everything
